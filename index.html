<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a>is located in San Antonio, Texas. It is a liberal arts school that was founded in 1869. It is a small campus with approximately 2500 students. </p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="https://cdn2.webdamdb.com/220th_sm_0awvDITMbNes.jpg?1488835253"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has rigorous classes and prepares its students for the workforce. 
Trinity students have access to many opportunities that they may not have at larger schools, such as close relationships with professors and small class sizes. Trinity students participate in a wide breadth of
interests, making each student unique and well rounded. There are also many study abroad opportunities that contribute to the well roundedness of the students. </p><br>

<p>The features I appreciate most at Trinity is the beautiful campus. Each day it seems like I discover something new and beautiful on campus, such as the meditation garden. It is also located in
a beautiful neighborhood in San Antonio with a lot of off campus activities. </p>

<p> I chose Trinity because of the proximity to home. I live 5 hours away so I am close enough to go home if I need to, but far enough that I am not going home every weekend. I also chose Trinity because of my options
it was the most affordable with financial aid and scholarships. </p>

<p>I am considering majoring in psychology because I loved taking principles of psychology and want to study the subject more deeply. Here are somelinks to important information about my chosen interest:
